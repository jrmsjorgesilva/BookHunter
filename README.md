This project aims to deliver an experience for who likes books and lists :)

# API KEY

You will need an API KEY to run this project.<br>
Go to "NewYorkTimesAPI.co.uk", then login and request you key.<br>
After that change the API KEY direct on the code (SearchAPI.js or TheKING.js) or create yourself a .env configuration to build.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser (Brave would be nice :) ).

Webpack's hot reload will refresh automatically.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Gulp setup

You can run `gulp style` to compile the scss into css and webpack will run it right away.
